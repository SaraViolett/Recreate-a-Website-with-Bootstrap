**Title:** Frameworks & Intro to JS | Recreate Your Favorite Website Using Bootstrap and JavaScript

**Description:** Part one of this assignment is to recreate a website using Bootstrap. I picked California Native Plant Society (CNPS) website (https://www.cnps.org/) to replicate for this project. In the second part of the assignment we are tasked with writing JavaScript functions to simulate features we'd like to implement in the future without integrating them into the site.

**Part One Requirements:**
1. Add a navigation Bar with 3 Links.
-Bootstrap was used to build a double navigation bar to replicate the CNPS website.
2. Build a homepage that matches the feel of the website youâ€™re emulating. Include headings, images, and a hero section to introduce the site.
-Bootstrap navbar, cards, carousel, and positioning were used to build the homepage. Image links from the CNPS site were used to match the look of the site as well as css styles file. 
3. Add a form for user input.
-Two forms were used, one as a Bootstrap modal when the "Join" button is selected on the navigation bar and the homepage hero image. The other form is on the "Get Involved" page.
4. Include a table to display relevant information.
-The table is on the "Our Work" page, it displays some of the work of CNPS.
5. Choose any three Bootstrap components that suit your website.

**Bootstrap components used:**
-Navigation Bar.
-Buttons on navigations bar, homepage, and footer.
-Cards on homepage.
-Carousel on news page.
-Modal on navigation bar and homepage

**Part Two Requirements:**
1. Write 4-5 JavaScript Functions
2. Submit the JavaScript File Separately:

**Functions**
1. This function takes the  radio type input selection from membership amount on the membership sign-up form and returns an array with those number values.
2. This function sums the values in the array created in the first function. 
3. This function creates an alert message that will pop-up to welcome new members when they submit the membership form.
4. This function creates a list of first names of members
